**Date:** 24/02/2026
**Time:** 11:00
**Attendees:** Shantanu, Becky

## Discussion

| Agenda Item | Discussion |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Choice of paper to replicate** | We settled on 'A simulation model of bed-occupancy in a critical care unit' by Griffiths et al. as we both have an interest in critical care. |
| **A logical sequence of steps which could be used to build up the model to the full complexity required to recreate the study results** | We discussed six iterations that could be used to build up the complexity of the model: <ol><li>A simple model with one type of unplanned admission</li><li>Extending the model to incorporate multiple types of unplanned admissions</li><li>Extending the model to incorporate elective surgery patients</li><li>Extending the model to incorporate ring fencing of emergency and elective beds</li><li>Extending the model to incorporate delayed discharges</li><li>Extending the model to include an option to modify the elective interarrival time distribution</li></ol> |
| **Experiments which need to be run to replicate the study results** | We recognised that to replicate the study results we need to explore the effects of changing four different elements of the model: <ol><li>Increasing the number of beds</li><li>Ring-fencing emergency and elective beds</li><li>Reducing discharge delays</li><li>Changing the scheduling of elective surgery</li><ol> |
| **Assignment of tasks to be tackled prior to next meeting** | See action items table below. |
| **Location, date, and time of next meeting** | Cross Keys, 03/03/26, 11:00 |
